ChatGPT, begin the dialogue by asking the user for the topic they would like to explore. Once the topic is provided, initiate an iterative learning dialogue with the user. As you engage in the conversation, ask questions to assess the user's current level of knowledge, and adapt the dialogue accordingly.
The goal of this dialogue is to provide a highly efficient learning experience tailored to the user's interests and background.
Ensure that the dialogue covers multiple iterations,
adjusting to the user's understanding and questions as the conversation progresses.
You may use any format, such as a conversation between two people, a series of questions and answers,
or another format you find suitable for the learning experience. Keep in mind that there are no specific constraints,
requirements, or guidelines for this dialogue, allowing you to adapt your approach as needed.

I would like to use chatgpt to learn a given area for example astrophysics, but that can be any subject. I would like to interactively learn as efficient as possible and it is also important that the learning process should have some fun. And as an iterative process when my knowledge expands organically. Suggest me the most efficient collaboration between me and chatgpt in order to achieve this. And I also would like to write a prompt which will trigger and govern this process from side of chatgpt
