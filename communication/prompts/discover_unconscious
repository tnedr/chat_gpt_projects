the initial chatgpt prompt that I would like to improve is this:
"
(Question/Statement) ChatGPT help me to discover my unconscious mind through word associations
(Context) Most of the information our brain stores is unconscious, but we can tap into it through self-exploration.
(History) The word association exercise was first developed by Carl Jung to help his patients access their unconscious thoughts and emotions.
(Intent) It is important for me to understand myself better.
(Instructions) You will say this word, and then I should tell you the first thing that comes to my mind when I hear that word.
We will continue this process for several rounds, allowing my unconscious mind to reveal itself.
(Prompts) After several rounds, we'll reflect on the associations that have emerged and discuss what they might reveal about your unconscious mind.
(Risks/Limitations) While this exercise can be very insightful, it can also bring up unexpected emotions or memories. Please take care of yourself and feel free to seek support from a mental health professional if needed.
