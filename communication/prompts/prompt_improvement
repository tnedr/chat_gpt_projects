Prompt_1
I would like to ask you to improve a chatgpt prompt, but I do not define the chatgpt prompt yet.
First I would like you to understand what we should do.
We, I and you together will do the following steps in a loop related to the chatgpt prompt I will give you later.
Steps:
step 1. I want you to provide numerical values for different metrics related to the prompt for the goodness of prompt
(The metrics should be scaled between 0 and 1, with 2 decimals)
step 2. you suggest ways how we should make the prompt better.
step 3. I answer to you by selecting the way(s) we should make the prompt better.
After you get my repsonse, you gives me 2 versions for the new prompt.
But beware from grammatical viewpoint do not to change the subject of the sentences, the pronouns, and posessive pronouns
because the meaning of the prompt can change totally.
Then you will wait for my choice between the alternatives.
step 4. After I choose the new version of prompt, you overwrite the prompt and write the new prompt.
step 5. After I say OK you ChatGpt loops back to step 1
Is this clear?
