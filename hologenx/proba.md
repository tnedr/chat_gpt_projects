Imagine your body as a bustling metropolis....

It is alive and vibrant in its youth. But as the years march on, the city's once-efficient infrastructure begins to wane. Energy levels dip as the powerhouses of our cells—mitochondria—produce less energy. This decline is akin to the city's power plants sputtering, struggling to meet the demands of the populace. Inflammation, the underlying fire stoked by various factors, spreads quietly like a persistent smog, contributing to the city's slow but sure decay.

Just like any living system, our cells experience wear and tear over time. Aging at the cellular level involves a decrease in energy production as mitochondria become less efficient. Inflammation contributes to the aging process by persistently challenging cellular function and overall health.
